EV Test Drive Audience Analysis and Retargeting Strategy
Overview
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing the target audience for electric vehicle (EV) test drives, using a combination of survey data, Mosaic UK segmentation, and Google Analytics insights. The goal is to create a data-driven marketing strategy to target potential customers effectively and optimize engagement with BMW's EV offerings.

Objectives
Audience Profiling: Identify key demographics, behaviors, and interests of individuals most likely to participate in EV test drives.
Mosaic Insights: Utilize the Mosaic UK 7 Grand Index to map target audiences to specific consumer group types and determine their geographic concentration.
Retargeting Strategy: Segment and refine BMW’s marketing campaigns based on audience engagement levels and intent to purchase.
Improved Data Processes: Highlight areas for improvement in data collection, survey design, and tracking mechanisms for EV test drive requests.
